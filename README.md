### **_Description_**

#### "GitHub for CRISPR gene editing." Full Stack app that allows users to create a profile, search genes, find sgRNA designs, and view data regarding the efficiency of their edits. 

#### Once a user logs in, they can view the available genes and browse 'verified' guide RNA sequences. Users can copy this sequence and create a 'branch' much like GitHub users can clone or fork repos. After designs are completed users perform an edit in the lab and document their results in this app. They can view their data in their personalized analytics page.

#### ** For educational purposes ONLY. Sequences stored in this app are not verified sgRNA designs and should not be referenced for actual edits. **

#### Currently the default value of passwordDigest in user model is 'crispr.' Will update with hashed passwords once user auth is implemented.
